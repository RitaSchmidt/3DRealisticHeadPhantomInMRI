# 3DRealisticHeadPhantomInMRI
STL files of a realistic head-shaped phantom for MRI imaging.
This repository includes two sets of STL files for 3D printed head-shaped phantom for MRI, prepared by the Schmidt lab - https://www.weizmann.ac.il/neurobiology/labs/schmidt/ . 

This design is based on Martinos Center’s phantom design - “MGH Angel 001” , that can be found under https://phantoms.martinos.org/MGH_Angel_001. See the following MGH group article for reference:
Bastien Guérin, Jason P. Stockmann, Mehran Baboli, Angel Torrado-Carvajal, Andrew V. Stenger and Lawrence L. Wald (2015). "Robust time-shifted spoke pulse design in the presence of large B0 variations with simultaneous reduction of through-plane dephasing, B1+ effects, and the specific absorption rate using parallel transmission." Magnetic resonance imaging, DOI: 10.1002/mrm.25902.

The current design includes two options:
1) Shimi - has the same dimensions as the Angel design. The inner part is the same, with changes in the design of the outer part. In this design we replaced all caps with screw caps and added additional hole and a cap at the bottom.
2) Gadi - smaller version (for tighter coil setups) with the changes above plus - reduced dimensions by 2% and manual removal of ~2 mm from the outer front and back parts.
